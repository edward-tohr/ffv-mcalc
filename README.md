TODO:

- ~~"next M at" for the rest of the M values~~
  - ~~pretty up the display~~
    - ~~Only show relevant M's based on job/abilities? That might do.~~

- boss HP/MP tracker
- get data offsets for eur version
- autodetect game version
- ~~write text in scracth space instead of vomiting it all over the game~~
